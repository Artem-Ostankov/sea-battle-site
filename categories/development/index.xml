      <description>Hi ppl !
New Friday came, and new update follows.
So there are 2 big changes.
Again all based on your mega-awesome feedback ! Thanks a lot for that ! :)
Change #1: Networking
Feedback: This would be awesome to play this game easy on website.
There are several problems here:
- I picked standard unity networking engine: UNet.
- in UNet connection matchmaking is somewhat slow.
- UNet feels quite limited in terms of extra features and integration outside of Unity</description>

      <description>I riched the point when sharing game binaries through skype or dropbox became just time-consuming. So I thought, it&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to finally launch a simple website where I would keep and share all versions of the game.
My last own site was built with HUGO and I got quite a good experience using that. Though I still felt a bit uncomfortable with HUGO templating DSL. So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to look for something more familiar and expressive.</description>
