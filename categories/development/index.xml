      <description>I riched the point when sharing game binaries through skype or dropbox became just time-consuming. So I thought, it&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to finally launch a simple website where I would keep and share all versions of the game.
My last own site was built with HUGO and I got quite a good experience using that. Though I still felt a bit uncomfortable with HUGO templating DSL. So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to look for something more familiar and expressive.</description>
